-- Buffer layer above epoll. Implemented using 'EventLoop's.
-- The general usage is that first an instance of 'Runtime' is obtained, then
-- one creates as many buffers as needed. Once done with a buffer, it has 
-- to be closed and finally the runtime should be shutdown, which kills 
-- the event loop, e.g.
--
-- @
-- do r <- createRuntime (fromJust . toSize $ 4096)
--    withIBuffer r stdInput $ \\b ->
--        readBuffer b >>= mapM_ print . take 10 . lines
--    shutdownRuntime r
-- @
--
-- Please note that one has to close all buffers before calling shutdown on
-- the runtime.
